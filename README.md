### Introduction
Solutions with tests cases for <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a> katas.

### Vocabulary

- Kata: is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire
- Kyu: is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank
- Dan: is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well the user rank
"The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu (or Kyū) indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward. Black belts in martial arts are Dan level"

### Purpose

Solving katas could help you to improve your algorithmic thinking and improve programming and analytical skills. It could also be handy at technical interviews.

### Disclaimer

- Participants are strongly encouraged not to look at solutions to Katas until they have completed those katas themselves
* Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars
