/*
 * The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at
 * the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100,
 * 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.
 * 
 * Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every
 * single person in this line.
 * 
 * Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has
 * no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?
 * 
 * Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with
 * the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.
