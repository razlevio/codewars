# [Bit Counting](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5262119038c0985a5b00029f)

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number.
You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

## Example

The binary representation of  `1234`  is  `10011010010`, so the function should return  `5`  in this case on language version). Looping all the way up to  `n`, or  `n/2`, will be too slow.
